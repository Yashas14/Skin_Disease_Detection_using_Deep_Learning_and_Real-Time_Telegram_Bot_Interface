# Skin_Disease_Detection_using_Deep_Learning_and_Real-Time_Telegram_Bot_Interface
This project presents an AI-driven solution for real-time skin disease detection using deep learning and chatbot integration. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained to classify common dermatological conditions such as Tinea Ringworm, Candidiasis, and Urticaria (Hives) based on image inputs.
