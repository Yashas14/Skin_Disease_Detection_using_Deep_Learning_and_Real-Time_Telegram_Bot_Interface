## 🧩 Project Overview

This project bridges **AI and accessibility** by building a platform where users can simply send an image through Telegram and instantly receive a prediction about possible skin diseases. It is especially useful in remote or resource-constrained settings where access to dermatological consultations is limited.

The model is built using **InceptionV3**, a powerful deep learning architecture fine-tuned for medical image classification. It is integrated into a lightweight **Telegram bot** that handles image input, pre-processing, prediction, and response—all in real time.

## 💡 Motivation

Access to dermatologists is often limited — especially in rural or resource-constrained environments. We wanted to:

- Democratize access to **early skin diagnostics**  
- Build a tool that’s easy to use for **any age group**  
- Showcase the power of **deep learning + chatbot interaction**  
- Keep it **lightweight**, **secure**, and **real-time**  

## 🚀 Features

- 🏥 Detects skin conditions like *Tinea Ringworm*, *Candidiasis*, and *Urticaria*
- 🤖 Deep Learning model using InceptionV3 (Transfer Learning)
- 📱 User-friendly Telegram Bot Interface
- 🔎 Real-time image processing and disease classification
- 📦 Efficient deployment using lightweight model format (`.keras`)
- 🧼 Auto image cleanup post-prediction
- 🔒 Private and offline predictions (can be hosted locally)

|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Python            | Core programming language                |
| TensorFlow / Keras| Model building and training              |
| NumPy             | Numerical operations                     |

## 🧠 Why InceptionV3?

InceptionV3 is a high-performing Convolutional Neural Network architecture developed by Google. It is particularly well-suited for medical image classification because:

- 🔍 **Deep architecture with fewer parameters**: Optimized computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
- 🧬 **Handles complex patterns** in high-resolution images.
- 🎯 **Pre-trained on ImageNet**: Transfer learning allows leveraging vast knowledge for small medical datasets.
- 🏃 **Efficient at inference time**, enabling near real-time predictions.
-  📈 **Superior performance on medical image datasets**

We use **Transfer Learning**, fine-tuning the pre-trained InceptionV3 on a custom dataset of skin disease images.



## 📁 Dataset

- Custom-curated dataset containing images of:
  - **Tinea/Ringworm/Candidiasis and other Fungal Infections**
  - **Urticaria (Hives)**
- Images were resized to `300x300` pixels for model compatibility.
- Split into training and testing sets for validation.
- Data Augmentation was applied to improve generalization.

> **Note**: Due to medical data restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. Please contact for access or use open dermatology image sources like HAM10000 or DermNet.



## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔄 Flow:
1. **User** sends an image of a skin condition to the **Telegram bot**.
2. Bot saves the image temporarily.
3. Preprocesses it into a format compatible with the trained model (`300x300` pixels, normalized).
4. Loads the trained model from a `.keras` file.
5. Runs the image through the **InceptionV3 CNN**.
6. Predicts the class (e.g., Tinea, Urticaria).
7. Sends back the disease name as a reply.



## 📲 Telegram Bot Interface

The bot is built using the [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library.

### 🔧 Setup:
- You must create a bot using [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).
- Replace the bot token in `telegram_bot_interface_new.py` with your own.

```python
application = Application.builder().token('YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN').build()



## 🧪 Model Training

Training the AI to become your skin specialist wasn't easy — but here's how we taught it to *see*.
